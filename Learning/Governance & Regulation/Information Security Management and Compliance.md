The strategic planning, execution, and continuous administration of security measures are all part of Information Security (IS) management, which **protects information assets from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, interruption, alteration, and destruction**. It involves risk assessment and identification, security controls and procedures development, incident response planning, and security awareness training. Contrarily, compliance refers to **observing information security-related legal, regulatory, contractual, and industry-specific standards**. In IS management and compliance, we will go through two key standards.

- [[ISO IEC 27001]]
- [[Service Organisation Control 2 (SOC 2)]]

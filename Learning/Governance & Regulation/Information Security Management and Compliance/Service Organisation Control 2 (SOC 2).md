**SOC 2** was developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) as a **compliance/auditing framework**. It focuses on assessing the efficacy of a company's data security based on the CIA triad. SOC 2 can reassure customers, stakeholders, and business partners that the company has put **sufficient controls in place to safeguard its systems, data, and sensitive information**.  

  

The SOC 2 framework is essential for service providers interacting with client data or offering solutions that **process, store, or transmit sensitive data**. It assists businesses in demonstrating their dedication to upholding strict privacy and security standards. Customers frequently ask for SOC 2 reports or use them as a competitive advantage to guarantee clients that their information will be handled securely. You can learn more about it

  
Important CardinalsÂ 

- SOC 2 is an auditing standard that evaluates the usefulness of a service organisation's controls related to confidentiality, availability, integrity, and privacy.
- Independent auditors conduct SOC 2 audits to determine that security controls meet the relevant criteria.
- SOC 2 reports provide valuable information to customers, stakeholders, and regulators on a service organisation's security and privacy practices. They can be used to demonstrate that the service organisation has adequate controls to protect the data and systems it uses to process customers' information. For example, a cloud computing company that provides infrastructure services to other businesses may undergo a SOC 2 audit to demonstrate its adequate controls to protect customer data stored on its servers. The audit may cover physical security, network security, data encryption, backup and recovery, and employee training and awareness.
- The SOC 2 audit report will assess the controls in place at the cloud computing company and include any findings or recommendations for improvement. The information can be shared with customers and other stakeholders to ensure the company takes appropriate measures to protect its data and systems.

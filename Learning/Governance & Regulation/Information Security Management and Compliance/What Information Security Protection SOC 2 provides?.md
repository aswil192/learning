The primary purpose of the SOC 2 audit is to ensure that third-party service providers store and process sensitive information securely.   
  

**Planning and Undergoing a SOC 2 Audit**

The following steps can be taken by an organisation’s management team before and during an audit:

- **Determine the scope**: This may include specific systems, processes, or locations that are relevant to the security and privacy of customer data.
- **Choose a suitable auditor**: Select a qualified auditor with experience conducting SOC 2 audits for financial companies. Consider factors such as the auditor's reputation, experience, and availability.
- **Plan the audit:** Work with the auditor to plan the audit, including the audit timeline, the scope of the audit, and the audit criteria.
- **Prepare for the audit**: Prepare for the audit by reviewing your security and privacy controls, policies, and procedures. Identify any gaps or deficiencies and develop a plan to address them.
- **Conduct the audit**: The auditor will review your controls and conduct testing to assess their effectiveness. The audit may include interviews with key personnel, documentation reviews, and controls tests.
- **Receive the audit report**: Once the audit is complete, the auditor will provide a report detailing the audit results. The report may include a description of your controls, any deficiencies or gaps identified, and recommendations for improvement.

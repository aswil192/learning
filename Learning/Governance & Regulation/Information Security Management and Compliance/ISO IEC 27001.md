**ISO 27001** is an internationally recognised standard for requirements to **plan, develop, run, and update** an organisation's Information Security Management System (ISMS). The official ISO/IEC 27001 documents are paid for and can be purchased from this. It was developed by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and has the following core components:

- **Scope**: This specifies the ISMS's boundaries, including the covered assets and processes.
- **Information security policy**: A high-level document defining an organisation's information security approach.
- **Risk assessment**: Involves identifying and evaluating the risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organisation's information.
- **Risk treatment**: Involves selecting and implementing controls to reduce the identified risks to an acceptable level.
- **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**: This document specifies which controls from the standard are applicable and which are not.
- **Internal audit**: This involves conducting periodic audits of the ISMS to ensure that it is operating effectively.
- **Management review**: Review the performance of ISMS at regular intervals.

An ISMS built on the ISO 27001 standard requires careful design and execution. It entails exhaustively evaluating the **organisation's security procedures, detecting gaps, and conducting a thorough risk assessment**. Access control, incident response, etc., are just a few examples of the areas where clear rules and processes must be created and aligned with ISO 27001 requirements. **Leadership support and resource allocation** are also essential for the ISMS to be implemented successfully. **Regular monitoring, measurement, and continual development** are crucial to guarantee the efficacy and continued alignment of the ISMS with the organization's objectives.

Cyber security is a rapidly evolving landscape wherein malicious actors relentlessly endeavour to exploit vulnerabilities in highly-sensitive systems, often with the intent of causing severe damage, disruption, and stealing of sensitive corporate data. To combat this evolving threat, a comprehensive approach to **information security governance & regulation**Â is necessary. Such an approach requires establishing robust policies and guidelines and implementing rigorous monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance. By adopting a proactive and strategic stance towards cyber security, organisations can mitigate the risks posed by malicious actors and safeguard their sensitive systems against potentially catastrophic breaches.

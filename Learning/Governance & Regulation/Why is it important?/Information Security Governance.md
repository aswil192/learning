Information security governance represents an organisation's established structure, policies, methods, and guidelines designed to guarantee the privacy, reliability, and accessibility of its information assets. Given the escalating complexity of cyber threats, the significance of information security governance is continually growing. It is essential for risk management, safeguarding confidential data from unauthorised intrusion, and adhering to pertinent regulations. Information security governance falls under the purview of top-tier management and includes the following processes:  


- **Strategy**: Developing and implementing a comprehensive information security strategy that aligns with the organisation's overall business objectives.
- **Policies and procedures**: Preparing policies and procedures that govern the use and protection of information assets.
- **Risk management**: Conduct risk assessments to identify potential threats to the organisation's information assets and implement risk mitigation measures.
- **Performance measurement**: Establishing metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the information security governance program.
- **Compliance**: Ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and industry best practices.

The GDPR is a data protection law implemented by the EU in May 2018 to protect personal data. Personal data is "_Any data associated with an individual that can be utilised to identify them either directly or indirectly_". Key points of the law include the following:  

-  **Prior approval** must be obtained before collecting any personal data.
-  Personal data should be kept to a **minimum** and only collected when necessary.
-  **Adequate measures** are to be adopted to protect stored personal data.

The law applies to all business entities that conduct business in the European Union (EU) and collect/store/process the personal data of EU residents and are required to comply. It is one of the most stringent data privacy regulations worldwide and safeguards personal data during collection. Companies can only collect personal data for a legitimate reason and must inform the owner about its processing. Moreover, this also includes penalties and fines based on non-compliance in the following two tiers:  

- Tier 1: More severe violations, including unintended data collection, sharing data with third parties without consent, etc. Maximum penalty amounting to 4% of the organisation's revenue or 20 million euros (whichever is higher).
- **Tier 2**: Less severe violations, including data breach notifications, cyber policies, etc. The maximum fine for Tier 2 is 2% of the organisation's revenue or 10 million euros (whichever is higher).

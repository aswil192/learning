Every set of related components is grouped as a single entity; components can be applications, data, or other resources. Each entity will have its own domain and be assigned a common set of security attributes. For example, consider the x86 processor privilege levels: the operating system kernel can run in ring 0 (the most privileged level). In contrast, user-mode applications can run in ring 3 (the least privileged level).Â Domain separation is included in the Goguen-Meseguer Model.

The security of a system is attacked through one of several means. It can be via the disclosure of secret data, alteration of data, or destruction of data.

- **Disclosure** is the opposite of confidentiality. In other words, disclosure of confidential data would be an attack on confidentiality.
- **Alteration** is the opposite of Integrity. For example, the integrity of a cheque is indispensable.
- **Destruction/Denial** is the opposite of Availability.

The opposite of the CIA Triad would be the DAD Triad: Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction.

Protecting against disclosure, alteration, and destruction/denial is of utter significance. This protection is equivalent to working to maintain confidentiality, integrity and availability.  
  
Protecting confidentiality and integrity to an extreme can restrict availability, and increasing availability to an extreme can result in losing confidentiality and integrity.Â Good security principles implementation requires a balance between the three.

Trust is a very complex topic; in reality, we cannot function without trust. If one were to think that the laptop vendor has installed spyware on the laptop, they would most likely end up rebuilding the system. If one were to mistrust the hardware vendor, they would stop using it completely. If we think of trust on a business level, things only become more sophisticated; however, we need some guiding security principles. Two security principles that are of interest to us regarding trust:

- [[Trust but Verify]]
- [[Zero Trust]]

Microsegmentation is one of the implementations used for Zero Trust. It refers to the design where a network segment can be as small as a single host. Moreover, communication between segments requires authentication, access control list checks, and other security requirements.  

There is a limit to how much we can apply zero trust without negatively impacting a business; however, this does not mean that we should not apply it as long as it is feasible.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have created the ISO/IEC 19249. In this task, we will brush briefly upon ISO/IEC 19249:2017 _Information technology - Security techniques - Catalogue of architectural and design principles for secure products, systems and applications_. The purpose is to have a better idea of what international organizations would teach regarding security principles.

- [[Domain Separation]]
- [[Layering]]
- [[Encapsulation]]
- [[Redundancy]]
- [[Virtualization]]

ISO/IEC 19249 teaches five _design_ principles:

- [[Least Privilege]]
- [[Attack Surface Minimisation]]
- [[Centralized Parameter Validation]]
- [[Centralized General Security Services]]
- [[Preparing for Error and Exception Handling]]

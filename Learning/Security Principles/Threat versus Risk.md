There are three terms that we need to take note of to avoid any confusion.

- **Vulnerability**: Vulnerable means susceptible to attack or damage. In information security, a vulnerability is a weakness.
- **Threat**: A threat is a potential danger associated with this weakness or vulnerability.
- **Risk**: The risk is concerned with the likelihood of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability and the consequent impact on the business.

Away from information systems, a showroom with doors and windows made of standard glass suffers a weakness, or _vulnerability_, due to the nature of glass. Consequently, there is a _threat_ that the glass doors and windows can be broken. The showroom owners should contemplate the _risk_, i.e.Â the likelihood that a glass door or window gets broken and the resulting impact on the business.
